      <p>“And this,” the old master Gideon lifted a frayed string with a lead bob at the end, “is our main and most precious tool. Don’t worry, it isn’t the only one we have…”</p>

      <p>Mavir wasn’t afraid, and the hints that he should be were getting on his nerves. Being from the surface didn’t make him a coward. Here in Kainrax they somehow treated those words as synonyms. His family barely let him go, his little sister cried, but he came anyway—for knowledge, for a grasp of the anomalies people up above only whispered about—and wound up as a junior apprentice to an old surveyor who smelled of fungal dust and machine oil.</p>

      <p>In the last three weeks Mavir learned every instruction. He memorized the maps—he could have drawn them in his sleep. Every day he did the standard drill: at different times of day, with his heartbeat at different tempos, he closed his eyes and counted out one minute, checking against a chronometer. He could hit it within half a second. Instruments could fail in the sectors, but one’s sense of rhythm had to remain flawless.</p>

      <p>“Let me,” Mavir took the plumb line from the wrinkled fingers. He held it with three, exactly as they taught at the University of Masters: focus steady, hand not shaking.</p>

      <p>“Think you can manage?”<br>
      “I can.”</p>

      <p>He brought the plumb to the wall. Measured with his eyes.<br>
      “Ninety point zero degrees,” he muttered. He drew it aside and began counting silently. The bob’s motion… one second, two… Once he’d checked the temporal sensor wasn’t lying, he sat by the column and pulled out his slate. “No gravitational deviations.”</p>

      <p>They were at a freshly built pumping station in sector B-23—a sterile humming kingdom of polished metal and thick cabling. The task was routine: a final verification before commissioning. And the old man with his plumb looked like a village healer waving a dried frog’s leg in the middle of an automated hospital.</p>

      <p>“No deviations, master,” he reported.</p>

      <p>He glanced at Gideon. The old man was sitting on a crate and talking to the shift lead, a stern man named Brokk.</p>

      <p>“You’ve got a new one already?.. last time it was someone else…”<br>
      “…the kid was only nineteen. Good engineer, quick. Fresh out of the Academy last cycle…”<br>
      “…the family got compensation. An accident. Fatigue.”</p>

      <p>Mavir rolled his eyes. Tragedies happened. They were part of the calculation, a permissible error in the operation of a complex system. The main thing was that it not affect the facility’s functionality.</p>

      <p>With the master distracted, the work went even faster. Mavir calibrated, checked, logged. He found a deviation: either the gravitational constant had shifted by a hundredth of a percent, or the time counter had glitched. He didn’t have the experience to tell which, and he looked over.</p>

      <p>“Master!” he called, and fell silent.</p>

      <p>The old man was talking to a young guy at the control panel.<br>
      “How are the kids?” Gideon asked softly, like an old friend.<br>
      “Fine, master. The older one started school.”<br>
      “That’s a joy…”</p>

      <p>Mavir shuddered. Clause 12.4 of the instructions: “Avoid unsanctioned emotional interaction with personnel…” Gideon was breaking it with a kind of simple-minded impunity.</p>

      <p>“Master!” Mavir shouted louder. “Got a glitch here!”</p>

      <p>Gideon turned. He patted the guy on the shoulder—“All right then, son”—and walked over. He took the temporal counter, took the plumb. Squatted and began to count.</p>

      <p>“Time’s drifting,” Gideon stood. “Write it down: a minus zero-point-three percent deviation, have them compensate. Gravity’s fine. Can you go on?”</p>

      <p>Mavir nodded. He didn’t call the master for the next anomaly. He measured, logged, measured, logged—and out of the corner of his eye watched the old man break every protocol imaginable. Mavir decided he would file a report on him. Detailed, with times and witnesses. He didn’t even see it as betrayal. The system had to be impeccable, and people like Gideon were a fault in it that needed correction. Besides, they’d surely commend Mavir for loyalty to the system and promote him—more knowledge then, more opportunities, and once they trusted him more he’d bring his sister down from the surface; she was sad without him, she wrote…</p>

      <p>“All done, master,” he reported when the last measurement was complete. “The facility is stable, except for five local temporal fluctuations. All logged in the protocol.”</p>

      <p>“Five?” Gideon grunted. “Good work. You found almost everything.”</p>

      <p>“What do you mean ‘almost’?” Mavir snapped. “There were five. And with all due respect, you picked up the plumb only once for the whole inspection.”</p>

      <p>Gideon smirked. “Come on, kid.”</p>

      <p>The old man led him deeper into the station, to a small, quiet operator node where the same young man sat at a console. He looked exhausted; his hands trembled slightly over the panel.</p>

      <p>“Your shift ending?” Gideon asked.<br>
      “Yes, master. One more hour,” the guy tried to smile.</p>

      <p>Gideon ignored that and, taking the plumb from Mavir, stepped up to the operator.<br>
      “Stand straight,” he said. He brought the bob to the man’s chest and set it swinging.</p>

      <p>And Mavir saw. Instead of a steady pendulum, the bob began to trace a barely noticeable but stubborn spiral, slowing in one spot and speeding up in another. It moved as if gravity around the guy had become viscous and uneven.</p>

      <p>“The human factor,” Gideon said quietly, stopping the plumb. “The sixth anomaly. And the most dangerous.”</p>

      <p>The guy’s face went pale. “But I’m healthy! I’ve been cleared! I…”</p>

      <p>“I know, son,” Gideon patted his shoulder. Mavir could have sworn even the tiny hairs on the old hand slowed beside the engineer. “Mavir”—for the first time, it seemed, the master used his name—“form C-12.”</p>

      <p>“Request for resource reallocation.” Mavir handed it over. Gideon filled it out quickly, stamped it, and passed it to the engineer.</p>

      <p>“Here, son. A report that the pressure regulator on this panel is faulty. By protocol, you immediately cease work and wait for the repair crew. They’ll arrive…” Gideon squinted mischievously, “…in about three hours. Enough time to go home and hug your kids. Got it?”</p>

      <p>The man nodded silently, staring at the form as if it were salvation.</p>

      <p>“And now you,” Gideon turned to Mavir as they stepped out of the room. “You have to sign as a witness. You saw it. The pressure regulator is defective.”</p>

      <p>“But it’s in perfect condition!” Mavir burst out. “That… that’s direct falsification! If he’s sick, he has to be sent to R! He’ll infect his own children… They’ll court-martial us both!”</p>

      <p>“Me, kid. They’ll rap your knuckles at most. You simply trusted your master,” he held out a pen. “The choice is yours. Sign—and that man will see his family today, and this station won’t blow up in a week. You think the Academy kid died from an ‘accident’? Refuse—and follow the protocol. Your career will be impeccable.”</p>

      <p>“I refuse,” Mavir said firmly. It violated everything he believed in.</p>

      <p>Gideon wasn’t surprised. “They don’t teach you at the University that people affect space far more than space affects people,” he said. “Sooner or later you’ll see how it works. If you refuse, you refuse, son. You must think I’m a sentimental fool, but I’m just good at my job. You’ll grow up—you’ll understand.”</p>

      <p>He turned and shuffled toward the exit. For the first time Mavir noticed how old and tired he was. Gideon couldn’t be more than fifty. They said people lived longer underground, but a very old man stood before him.</p>

      <p>Mavir was left alone. He looked at the plumb in his hand. He stepped to the spot where the engineer had just been standing and set the bob swinging.</p>

      <p>A perfect pendulum.</p>

      <p>The temporal sensor—zero. Gravitational constant—nominal.</p>

      <p>Mavir looked again at the form that lacked only his signature. A form that would pair perfectly with a denunciation.</p>

      <p>He bit the tip of his pencil.</p>
